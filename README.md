 This project presents an efficient cluster-analysis â€“ driven technique for variogram estimation in cases of irregularly-sampled fields with clustered
variogram clouds. The cluster analysis required for this technique is implemented using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). This technique has been applied to a real field to obtain a stable, interpretable and geologically consistent
variogram plot. It has also been applied to a synthetic field and was found to give the lowest estimation error among other techniques. This technique would
find usefulness in geo-modeling of natural resource deposits wherein irregular sampling is prevalent.
